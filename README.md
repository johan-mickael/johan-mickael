### Hi folks, I'm Jo... that doesn't matter..

## **But this kitty does!!! Yeahhhh 😺**

I'm a **Web & Mobile Developer**—by day I code (and sometimes gripe), and by night I strum my guitar.  
*Trying to make a buck and hoping AI doesn’t steal my job before 60!* 🥹  
*P.S. I mostly speak French (and Malagasy, yeah I like to move it move it 🇲🇬), but I'm learning English from TV shows. Don't judge I’m a work in progress. Paris is home for now (but maybe I'll move later... HELP meee!)*

## A Day in My Life

- **Morning:** Coffee + cigarette, grumbling about code. ☕🚬  
- **Afternoon:** Starving because of a weird bug. 🤯  
- **Evening:** Cheers to fixed bugs or playing a sad tune on guitar 'cause debugging sucks. 🎸😢  
- **3AM:** Still here, tweaking this low-cost README. 🌙

## My Philosophy & Approach

"... to keep my code as tidy as my guitar strings (most days 😜)"

- **Tech is just a tool:** It’s all about the vibe, not the language.
- **SOLID & Clean Code:** My code is like my coffee—strong, clear, and sometimes a hot mess.
- **Keep it Simple:** Whether sync or async, I just get stuff done.
- **Test First, Party Later:** TDD keeps the bugs away.
- **Containers & Pipelines:** CI/CD stops my code from turning into spaghetti.

### ⚠️ CAUTION: Tech Stack Truth Bomb

> **Disclaimer:** This tech stack section is mostly BS. I’ve mainly rocked **Symfony** and **VueJS** at work. The rest? Just some school projects and side gigs. Don’t judge too hard!
